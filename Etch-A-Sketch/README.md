Project created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript as part of the Odin Project

### Functionality
- Dragging the slider will either decrease or increase the number of grids being created
- User will have a choice of color they can sketch with or randomly generated number

## Problems I faced during the project:
- Not knowing the difference between constructor functions and regular functions and proper usage of "this" syntax. Had to figure
out that "this" is not a variable.
- Syntax errors that took way longer than it should have to solve.

## What I learned:
- DOM manipulation
  -Using DOM manipulation to append and delete new div to in order to make new grids for sketching
- Anonymous functions
  -Used anonymous functions when calling functions for AddEventListener whenever a new input was recognized.
- Callback functions
  -Used a function as part of an argument for another function. e.g. Called a new function whenever a user wanted a new color and passed that same value to a
   existing function to apply when changing the div's background color.
- Constructor functions
  -Unknowingly used constructor function without realizing what it did. Had to google what it exactly did.
